# YT-repost-detection
 Detects YT links that were previously posted

Isn't it annoying when you post a youtube link, just for someone else to post the same link a few hours, or days later?

Introducing YTRD (yes it sounds like why turd). 

This bot will detect reposted youtube URLs and blast the user responsible for reposting with reactions and a big message that tells them they are a reposter.

This bot is extremely useful and life changing.
